I want to illustrate my skills to help me get hired in the field

I am currently a trucker driver but I have a very real passion for software!

I have been having a difficult time getting an interview as I am sure you can imagine when I say that I am a trucker driver trying to be a software engineer.
This site is designed to deminstrate my java skills.  
I can add this site along with my github account to my resume!
